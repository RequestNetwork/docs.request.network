# Share an encrypted request

The content of an encrypted request can be shared to additional third parties using the `addStakeholder` feature.

Calling `request.addStakeholder()` allows any stakeholder of a request to add the public key of a third party as a stakeholder on a request. The third party can now read the content of the request.

Feature exists. Docs coming soon...
