# Add Stakeholder

The `add-stakeholder` component allows Builders to quickly integrate the [Request Finance Add Stakeholder](https://docs.request.finance/faq#i-am-integrating-the-request-network.-can-i-get-access-to-users-data-on-request-finance) widget into their applications.

The Request Finance Add Stakeholder widget provides a dialog box for end-users to grant third-party access to one of their encrypted payment requests created via Request Finance. Then, under the hood, Request Finance calls `request.addStakeholders()` to add the third party as a stakeholder to the encrypted payment request.

{% hint style="info" %}
Access is granted on a per-request basis. Once we prove market demand for this feature, we hope that Request Finance will improve its widget to allow granting access to multiple requests at a time.
{% endhint %}
