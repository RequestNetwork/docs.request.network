# Installation

The best way to access Request Network is using the Request Network SDK with a Request Node. In this way, the Request Node operator pays the protocol fee for creating requests and reduces the number of transactions signed by the end user resulting in a better user experience.

The Request Network SDK is split into multiple packages so that Builders can pick and choose the features they need.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For now, we recommend installing the Request Network SDK using the same `@next` version of each package. This is temporary and we are working on fixing our release process.

```bash
npm install @requestnetwork/request-client.js@next
npm install @requestnetwork/web3-signature@next
npm install @requestnetwork/payment-processor@next
```
{% endhint %}

## External Packages

These are the packages that we think would be most commonly used by Builders to build applications.

For a list of internal packages, see [Internal Packages](request-network-client-introduction.md#internal-packages).

## Import the packages

The Request Client library is available as a UMD or CommonJS module and can be used in both node applications and web pages.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="UMD" %}
<pre class="language-tsx"><code class="lang-tsx"><strong>import { RequestNetwork } from '@requestnetwork/request-client.js';
</strong><strong>import { Web3SignatureProvider } from '@requestnetwork/web3-signature';
</strong><strong>import { payRequest } from '@requestnetwork/payment-processor';
</strong></code></pre>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CommonJS" %}
```tsx
const { RequestNetwork } = require('@requestnetwork/request-client.js');
const { Web3SignatureProvider } = require('@requestnetwork/web3-signature');
const { payRequest } = require("@requestnetwork/payment-processor");
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Internal Packages

These packages are published publicly but contain functions that are internal to the [External Packages](request-network-client-introduction.md#external-packages). It is less likely that a Builder would need to use these packages.
