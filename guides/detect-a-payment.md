# Detect a payment

Request payments can be detected easily, thanks to the integration of The Graph.

Our [payment-subgraphs](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/payments-subgraph) indexes Request's proxy smart contracts and allow you to query payment data easily.

Other methods are available to detect a payment by simply watching the Proxy Smart Contract used for payment. Payment transactions include a `paymentReference`.
